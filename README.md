--Railway Customer & Revenue Analysis (SQL Project)
This project explores a railway ticketing dataset using SQL to uncover insights into customer behavior, revenue trends, operational performance, and service efficiency. It's designed as part of my data analytics portfolio to demonstrate SQL skills in querying, aggregating, and analyzing business-critical data.

-- Project Overview
The dataset used simulates real-world railway ticket purchases and includes attributes such as ticket class, payment methods, departure stations, journey status, delay reasons, refund requests, and more. The primary goal of this project is to analyze:

Customer & Purchase Behavior
Revenue Streams
Operational Efficiency
Customer Service Metrics
Time-Based Trends

--Tools Used
SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)

1. Customer and Purchase Behavior
Identified the top-selling routes by ticket count.
Analyzed ticket class and purchase channel preferences.
Observed popular payment methods, useful for enhancing UX.

2. Revenue Analysis
Calculated daily revenue trends over time.
Broke down revenue by:

Ticket type (e.g., single, round-trip)
Purchase type (e.g., online, in-person)

3. Operational Efficiency
Computed delay rates by station, highlighting logistical weak points.
Identified the most common reasons for delays.

4. Customer Service
Assessed refund request rates and their relationship to journey delays.
Evaluated customer service performance based on transactional patterns.

5. Time-Based Trends
Categorized purchases into morning, afternoon, evening, and night.
